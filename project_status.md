# H2Climate Project Status

## Learning Objectives Status

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

✅ 1. Using OOP for console programs with multiple classes

- Implemented through multiple classes in the `src` directory
- Classes include: `DisplayManager`, `NetworkManager`, `SensorManager`, `BatteryMonitor`

✅ 2. Basic knowledge of programming language/framework

- Arduino C++ framework
- WiFiS3 library for network connectivity
- ArduinoJson for data handling
- TimeLib for time management

✅ 3. Defining and designing custom classes

- Custom classes for each major component
- Well-structured class hierarchy

✅ 4. Declaring and instantiating objects

- Global objects in main sketch
- Proper initialization in setup()

✅ 5. Understanding and using collections

- Using arrays for data buffering
- JSON documents for data transmission

✅ 6. Following coding standards

- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper code organization
- Clear comments and documentation

✅ 7. Exception handling

- Error checking for sensor readings
- Network connection error handling
- Battery monitoring error handling

✅ 8. OOP concepts

- Encapsulation: Private methods and properties
- Inheritance: Class hierarchies
- Polymorphism: Interface implementations

✅ 9. OOP application development

- Complete application using OOP principles
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

✅ 10. Abstract classes and methods

- Abstract interfaces for sensor management
- Abstract display patterns

✅ 11. Method override vs overload

- Proper method overriding in inherited classes
- Method overloading for different parameter types

✅ 12. Access modifiers

- Proper use of public/private members
- Protected access where needed

✅ 13. Function pointers/callbacks

- Event handling for network events
- Callback functions for sensor readings

✅ 14. Generic classes and methods

- Template-based data structures
- Generic sensor interfaces
